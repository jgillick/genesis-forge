# ðŸ’¡ Overview

Genesis Forge is a modular framework for RL robot environments, inspired by [Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/tree/main),
and built on top of the awesome [Genesis Simulator](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/tree/main). The goal
is to provide the tools to get your training library up and running quickly, with less of the upfront boilerplate work, and a structure
that makes growing projects feel more manageable.

# Introduction managers

The preferred way to use Genesis Forge is through its management architecture. A manager is a Python class dedicated to a very specific part
of your training program. There are managers for the reward system, actions, defining observations, etc. When you use managers, your main environment script becomes more of a flexible configuration center and should contain less logic.

Here's an example of defining the RewardManager:

```python
self.reward_manager = RewardManager(
    self,
    cfg={
        "base_height_target": {
            "weight": -50.0,
            "fn": rewards.base_height,
            "params": {
                "target_height": 0.3,
            },
        },
        "lin_vel_z": {
            "weight": -1.0,
            "fn": rewards.lin_vel_z_l2,
        },
        "action_rate": {
            "weight": -0.005,
            "fn": rewards.action_rate_l2,
        },
        "similar_to_default": {
            "weight": -0.1,
            "fn": rewards.dof_similar_to_default,
        },
    },
)
```

As you can see, this defines 4 rewards, and references the functions used to generate those rewards. This manager will also log the individual reward values to the `extras["episode"]` dict, for logging through frameworks like rsl_rl or skrl. If your environment uses curriculum learning, you can
dynamically change the reward configurations as the training program progresses.

For example, to adjust the weights:

```python
self.reward_manager.cfg["base_height_target"]["weight"] = -25.0
self.reward_manager.cfg["similar_to_default"]["weight"] = -0.05
```

## Available Managers

Genesis Forge provides a collection of managers to handle different aspects of your RL environment:

- **ActionManager**: Processes raw actions from your RL policy and send them to your actuators.
- **ObservationManager**: Defines observations and manages the observation space
- **RewardManager**: Computes and tracks individual reward components
- **TerminationManager**: Handles episode termination conditions
- **CommandManager**: Manages high-level commands for goal-conditioned tasks
- **EntityManager**: Handles robot spawning, resets, and state management
- **ContactManager**: Tracks contacts and collisions between robots and the environment
- **TerrainManager**: Provides useful functions for working with various terrains.

# Do I have to exclusively use managers?

Not at all. Managers should take some of the work out of your environment, however, you can still define build, step, and reset methods for functionality that is not contained inside the mangers.

For example:

```python

class MyFirstEnv(ManagedEnvironment):
    # ...

    def config(self):
        """Configure all the managers that handle different aspects of the environment."""
        # ...

        RewardManager(
            self,
            logging_enabled=True,
            cfg={
                # Maintain target height
                "base_height": {
                    "weight": -50.0,
                    "fn": rewards.base_height,
                    "params": {"target_height": 0.3},
                },
                # ...
            },
        )
        # ...

    def step(self, actions: torch.Tensor):
        # Keep the camera fixed on the robot
        self.camera.set_pose(lookat=self.robot.get_pos()[0])
        return super().step(actions)

    def reset(self, envs_idx: list[int] | None = None):
        # Perform any curriculum adjustments
        self._curriculum(env_ids)
        return super().reset(envs_idx)

    def _curriculum(self, envs_idx: list[int] | None = None):
        # ... curriculum logic here ...
```
