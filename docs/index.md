Genesis Forge is a powerful framework for building reinforcement learning environments using the [Genesis](https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) physics simulator. It provides a flexible and modular architecture to get your robot up and running quickly with less boilerplate work.

## Key Features

- ⚙️ Modular composable environment design
- 💥 Comprehensive contact/collision manager
- 🎬 Automatically record video snippets during training
- 🕹️ Connect a game controller for hands-on policy evaluation and play-mode.
- 🤖 Seamless integration with popular RL libraries: RSL-RL and SKRL
