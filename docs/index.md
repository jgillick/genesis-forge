Genesis Forge is a powerful robotics reinforcement learning framework using the [Genesis](https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) physics simulator. It provides a flexible and modular architecture to get your robot up and running quickly with less boilerplate work.

## RL Robotics What?

Today, modern robots learn to balance, walk, manipulate objects, and more, using AI/[Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit1/what-is-rl) algorithms. You simply create a program that defines a task and provides feedback on the robot's performance ‚Äî much like training a dog with treats and commands. Genesis Forge is a framework that makes this very easy to, with [documentation](https://genesis-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/index.html) and [examples](https://github.com/jgillick/genesis-forge/tree/main/examples) to get you started.

## Key Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular composable environment design
- üí• Comprehensive contact/collision manager
- üé¨ Automatically record video snippets during training
- üïπÔ∏è Connect a game controller for hands-on policy evaluation and play-mode.
- ü§ñ Seamless integration with popular RL libraries: [RSL-RL](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl/tree/main) and [SKRL](https://skrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
