Genesis Forge is a powerful framework for building and training reinforcement learning environments using the Genesis physics simulator.
It provides a flexible and modular architecture for getting your robot up and running quickly while spending less time on the boilerplate work.

## Key Features

- Modular Environment Design: Build complex environments using composable managers
- Built-in RL Integration: Seamless integration with popular RL libraries (SKRL, RSL-RL)
- Comprehensive contact/collision manager
- Automatically record video snippets during training
- Interfaces with game controllers for hands-on policy evaluation and play-mode.
