Genesis Forge is a powerful framework for building and training reinforcement learning environments using the Genesis physics simulator.
It provides a flexible and modular architecture for getting your robot up and running quickly while spending less time on the boilerplate work.

## Key Features

- Modular Environment Design: Build complex environments using composable managers
- Built-in RL Integration: Seamless integration with popular RL libraries (SKRL, RSL-RL)
- Flexible Observation and Action Spaces: Easily customize inputs and outputs for your agents
- Rich Reward System: Compose complex reward functions from simple building blocks
- Terrain Generation: Create varied training environments with procedural terrain
- Hardware Integration: Support for gamepad control and real robot deployment
